#### My address was eligible for the previous campaign. Why is it not eligible for the latest one? <a href="#my-address-was-eligible-for-the-previous-campaign.-why-is-it-not-eligible-for-the-latest-one" id="my-address-was-eligible-for-the-previous-campaign.-why-is-it-not-eligible-for-the-latest-one"></a>

Each campaign has its own eligibility requirements, like the unlock time of the CAKE staking position.

You may need to extend your staking position. Simply follow the instructions on the page.

#### Why I traded a lot but only received a very small amount of rewards <a href="#why-i-traded-a-lot-but-only-received-a-very-small-amount-of-rewards" id="why-i-traded-a-lot-but-only-received-a-very-small-amount-of-rewards"></a>

The amount of the trading reward is based on the trading fee paid in those trades.

If your trades are routed through pairs with a low fee tier, for example, 0.01%, you are paying a very small fee for your trade. Therefore the number of rewards will become lower accordingly.

#### Why is it telling me I have additional rewards that can not be claimed? <a href="#why-is-it-telling-me-i-have-additional-rewards-that-can-not-be-claimed" id="why-is-it-telling-me-i-have-additional-rewards-that-can-not-be-claimed"></a>

The amount of CAKE locked in the position will determine the maximum amount of rewards you can earn from the campaign. Check out the footnote from the “Max Reward Cap” section.

While a campaign is active, you can add more CAKE to the lock and raise this cap at any time.

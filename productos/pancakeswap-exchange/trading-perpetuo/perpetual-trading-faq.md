We expect this new feature to bring in a lot of new users, traders and volume. We want to ensure the value goes back to our CAKE token on top of offering the trading fee discount. 20% of all trading fees from users who sign up on PancakeSwap will be converted to CAKE and burnt.

The rest are currently reserved for the treasury for ongoing expansion and development of this feature, as well as for an insurance fund for unexpected market events. As the feature matures, we expect to increase the burn portion gradually based on community feedback and governance.

# Affiliate Program

PancakeSwap’s Affiliate Program is designed to reward those who continue to help expand the community and share our product. The program will be available at the start to a select group of PancakeSwap advocates, and the Kitchen plans to roll it out to more users. As an affiliate, you'll be part of a network of like-minded individuals committed to building a stronger DeFi community.

### Becoming an Affiliate

Becoming an affiliate is easy. All you need to do is visit our [affiliate page](https://pancakeswap.finance/affiliates-program), where you will find all the information you need to get started. Alternatively, you can fill out a [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfP43IciQ5cH0JhTf1fDgUpwapBx-yD3ybv24pBdiVW7Th5jQ/viewform). For more information about the affiliate program please contact our team on [Telegram](https://t.me/pancakeswap).

Once you’ve submitted your application the Kitchen will review your application and determine if you are a good fit for the program. This process may take some time, so please bear with us!

If the Kitchen approves your application, you will be granted access to the affiliate dashboard by connecting your wallet submitted in the program application.

This dashboard will provide you with a range of tools and resources that you can use to share the company’s products or services and track your commission.

Once you have access to the dashboard, you can create affiliate links that you can share with your community. When a new user clicks on your affiliate link and makes a specific transaction, you will earn a commission accordingly. Ensure that you always use your affiliate link when you're sharing your love for PancakeSwap!

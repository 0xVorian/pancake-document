#### Why there isn't an "Enable" button? <a href="#why-there-isnt-an-enable-button" id="why-there-isnt-an-enable-button"></a>

On Aptos, coins don't have to be enabled/approved for spending. So there is no need to enable contract spending on farms. Simply click the "deposit" button to start farming.

Yes, unlike crosschain farming, you will earn CAKE rewards natively on Aptos.

With our multichain expansion and deployment on Aptos. CAKE is now a multichain token that exists both on BNB Smart Chain and Aptos.

CAKE on Aptos is equal to CAKE on BNB Smart Chain and can always be bridged between two chains with a 1:1 ratio.

Please note that there is only one CAKE. There are no different versions of CAKE between different chains. And the total supply of CAKE across all blockchains will be capped at 750M, according to our v2 tokenomic litepaper.

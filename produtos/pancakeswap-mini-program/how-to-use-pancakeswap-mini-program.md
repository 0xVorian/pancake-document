# How to Use PancakeSwap Mini-Program?

It is very important to note that assets that have transferred from spot wallet to the DeFi wallet are now out of the Binance centralized, custodial system, hence, all transactions such as transfer, swap, staking would require BNB for the gas fees to complete the transactions on BNB Smart Chain. Without BNB in your DeFi Wallet, none of the functions in the Mini-Programs would work, so be sure to have some BNB in your DeFi Wallet!

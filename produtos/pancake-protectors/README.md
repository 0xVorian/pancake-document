[Pancake Protectors](https://protectors.pancakeswap.finance/)

is an interactive, tower-defense inspired game which is a collaboration between PancakeSwap and Mobox, two established protocols on the BNB Chain.

Players can engage in both single-player and multiplayer elements. Hope you have fun!

At the beginning of the game, there is a simple tutorial which explains the general gameplay and how to use the starting level characters.

The tutorial does not cover advanced gameplay mechanics, as this is for players to research and find the best ways to play. We recommend you go to our community channels in PancakeSwapâ€™s Telegram and Discord channels to see what other players are discussing.

Pancake Protectors is not a play-to-earn style of game where actions are automatically rewarded with BEP-20 tokens. Instead, users can spend CAKE in-game for various features (e.g. recruiting CAKE Heroes), and all spent CAKE are distributed in the following manner:

| Category                                   | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Returned to users through seasonal rewards | 70%        |
| CAKE burn                                  | 12.5%      |
| Mobox                                      | 5%         |
| Future developments                        | 12.5%      |

# Controlling CAKE supply

By reducing the amount of CAKE made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://voting.pancakeswap.finance/#/pancake/proposal/QmWSQZsqakCMQ1bmcoEsKzStdtdFHL6cohSjnMV9ira1EC), we've already effectively reduced the number of CAKE entering circulation from 40 CAKE per block to 13.75. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, we want to still incentivize people to provide liquidity.

#### Overview

veCAKE holders have voting rights in PancakeSwapâ€™s governance system. These are the topics that are within the scope of governance:

1. \[Core] High-level CAKE emission adjustments (allocating CAKE to Core Pools and other high-level categories)
2. \[Core] Protocol adjustments (product changes, fee changes)
3. \[Core] Multichain warchest spending
4. Regular gauges voting (every 2 weeks)

Core topics must be voted on by veCAKE holders, but can only be proposed by the PancakeSwap Core Team.&#x20;

#### Veto

The PancakeSwap Core Team has veto rights, and can perform corrective actions when it concerns the security or proper functioning of the protocol, without going through a Snapshot poll. In the case of any veto action, the PancakeSwap Core Team will provide an explanation.

Possible actions include, but are not limited to:

1. Pausing relevant smart contracts while fixing a critical bug in the protocol
2. Rejecting a gauge that was successfully added if the token(s) in question is deemed unsafe, malicious, and/or detrimental to the PancakeSwap ecosystem

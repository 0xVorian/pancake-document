#### Example of an IFO Process

1. Initial Outreach
   * We have a lovely chat about your target launch date, your goals for TGE, and your team decides to start the process - let's go!
   * Apply via respective forms - [BNB Chain](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0Vmy3k0KyXtXwqxr8QLjD8Xd6KBAmkYxcBRRVTUYJVX17fA/viewform), [Etheruem](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeD3FvRD7TOw-\_6tZ5LjpGEN1NsC21hzlzNmNqq-djOYyGjbw/viewform), [Aptos](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9gWv9L8U0PGYgl-ymeX1qgXncBSlJ1HV5gB6ZeW7e4ekV\_w/viewform), [Arbitrum](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KGNXkgX7uaRgpu12sE6fbNZfJoahGWAU9i-oB4-ChUY/viewform), [Polygon zkEVM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mK6ma1jnrxPtN7nTXdwirmLDc1W9hrTsR63PssEzyJw/viewform), [zkSync Era](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/183KIVRvR45yr7VdfLG6svNvMjva-M799ZNqF-CtXv2Y/viewform), or [Linea](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedf06t0vrG9VEwFENINv1MVpckwiPq2SEvIpByJKVZaFPPTw/viewform) (Average time to fill up form: ‚â§14 minutes)
2. Due Diligence
   * Using the information in the form, we would clarify some points
   * For our IFOs, compared to our Syrup Pools/Farms, there is a bit more discussion: we are happy to share our knowledge of best practices with regard to tokenomics, product, Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy, etc.
   * Team passes due diligence ‚Äì congrats!
3. Marketing Prep
   * We will ask for some design assets, and some project info, and create both a lovely banner (Wombat Exchange example below) and a [vote proposal](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/bafkreieqv7mbzmumyftstt6l32x6okfzq4syrea7k5zbqgohhcekcvbduu?chainId=56) (BNB Chain) / blog post (non-BNB Chain)
   * We will also start collating questions for the AMA
   * We will typically run a week-long [marketing campaign](https://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1562802361705578502) which can include activities like social engagement, meme competitions, airdrops, project-specific tasks, etc.
   * Please note that prior to launch, PancakeSwap or Project Teams should not communicate the news of the collaboration.
4. [AMA](https://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1562648945721212929) (usually 1 day before IFO)
   * An interactive session with our community to clarify any questions and establish ‚ú®vibes‚ú®
5. IFO Launch
   * We will launch the IFO, and through our team of community admins, we will monitor, collate, and communicate any feedback raised by the community
   * We will also publish some marketing materials on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pancakeswap/status/1564616363871678484) and [Telegram](https://t.me/PancakeSwap)
6. Post-Launch
   * We would continue to stay in touch, and work together wherever possible! E.g. our post-IFO Wombat partnership using PancakeSwap Bridge [here](http://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1566694245213556737)

At every step of the process, the team is here to help ‚Äì we understand that for founders and their teams, the IFO or TGE is extremely critical, and we leave nothing to chance.\

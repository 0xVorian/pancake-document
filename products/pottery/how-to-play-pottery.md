# How to Play Pottery

PancakeSwap’s Pottery is an alternative way to stack CAKE other than just locking and staking your CAKE in the staking pool, this guide will walk you through how to navigate in the PancakeSwap web UI to participate.

A new Pottery cohort is created on the first Monday of each month. Each cohort may have different amounts of CAKE deposited which would affect the weekly prize pool and your odds of winning. The bigger the total value locked in that cohort, the larger the weekly prize pool, but with the same CAKE deposit size you may also get a lower odds of winning. You can view how much CAKE have been deposited and your odds here from the Deposit panel:

The deposit for each Pottery cohort is open once a month. The deposit closes and locks away the cake on the first Monday of the month at 23:59 UTC and it opens from the Friday before at around 10:00 UTC. This is to combine all the deposits and direct them for the locked staking at once for efficient staking rewards management and allocation. For the rest of the time, you will see this:

– which means the deposit is currently closed until the next monthly first Monday. If the deposit is open, you will see this instead:

– In this case, you can deposit your CAKE to participate in the Pottery if the APY, total value locked, and the odds of winning are acceptable to you. Before you deposit, please make sure you fully understand the risks of participating! All deposits will be locked for 10 weeks with no early withdrawal under any circumstances.

After you have deposited, you can view your total deposit and deposit by each cohort in the Claim panel:

There might occasionally be some delay because of the Subgraph reading, there will be a signal when there are delays – usually it should show the correct amount if you check again in 15 minutes. Please note that the withdrawal button will light up and be available only after 10 weeks of the lock date.

After each draw on Friday at around noon UTC, you can view the results and winners in the Finished Rounds panel:

Based on the drawn date, find the corresponding round for the cohort you would like to check – on each Friday, there could be more than one draw since there are different cohorts, make sure you’re checking the right draw for the cohort you’re looking for.

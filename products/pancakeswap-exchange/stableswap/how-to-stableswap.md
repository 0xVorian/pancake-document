## **Trading on the StableSwap**

Trading on the StableSwap is very similar to using the existing PancakeSwap AMM. Before we start, it also requires a BNB Smart Chain-compatible wallet and BNB for gas fees. Please check our [wallet guide](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started/wallet-guide) for more details.

1 - Go to the Swap page [here](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap)

2 - Choose the token pairs you would like to trade.&#x20;

3 - Your all set! The following Swap process is the same as usual! If itâ€™s your first time trading please check the guide [here.](../trade-guide.md)

**Adding & Removing Liquidity**

Adding and removing liquidity for the StableSwap is also very important and similar to the normal PancakeSwap AMM. Please refer to the guide [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/pancakeswap-exchange/liquidity-guide) for a more detailed explanation. PancakeSwap StableSwap liquidity pools will show "Stable LP" in the pool name.

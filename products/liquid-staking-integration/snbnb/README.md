# SnBNB

SnBNB is the yield bearing & liquid staking token for Synclub, which appreciates against BNB in line with BNB's staking APR. Unlike traditional staking, where staked assets are locked in the contract, liquid staked tokens can be transacted or used as collateral to earn yield across the DeFi ecosystem.

[Synclub recently merged with Helio Protocol](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helio-protocol-synclub-merge-paving-035000139.html?guccounter=1\&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8\&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAABDEZ\_TarGE4xWbi6AKki0RiL3fgR0aI\_vnW46DZGoJdbiZqererl49lv3VoXA3I87QMm2EmggovhnRg2bd1vMxRJcnhuApH4bzjUufQMGzKMPkxHaP7f6zeYVTh-BwIMrVvEOkRjgoEgf6KeKHarqhV5IWkYcIoA3npFuk0Bg1i), a leading DeFi player to drive LSTFi trends, leveraging the power of liquid staking tokens for efficient yield generation of its decentralised stablecoin, HAY.\

#### How does WBETH generate staking rewards?

Liquid Staking Derivatives generate staking rewards through the Ethereum network. The Ethereum network has now finished the Merge, which means that the consensus mechanism of ETH has been upgraded to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) instead of the previous Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism. In the case of WBETH, Binance offers users the option to stake their ETH to earn rewards. When you stake ETH via Binance, you will get BETH (representing your staked ETH) as the reward for staking your ETH. WBETH is the 1:1 wrapped version of BETH that can be used on-chain.&#x20;

#### What staking APR can I get from liquid staking?

For Ethereum staking rewards, the more ETH is staked, the lower the rewards are. Post-merge, the APY is hovering at around 3-5% for Ethereum validators. For WBETH, the daily APR is published by the Binance Earn team [here.](https://www.binance.com/en/eth2)

#### How can I get WBETH?

To get WBETH, you can stake your ETH on our [liquid staking page](https://pancakeswap.finance/liquid-staking). This service is available on both BNB Chain and Ethereum Chain.

#### What is the difference between WBETH and BETH?

WBETH is the wrapped version of BETH. Unlike BETH, WBETH can be obtained and utilized on-chain. For a side-by-side comparison, visit this [page](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-introduces-wrapped-beacon-eth-wbeth-on-eth-staking-a1197f34d832445db41654ad01f56b4d).

#### How can I use WBETH?

While accruing ETH staking rewards, you can use WBETH to explore other DeFi use cases including swapping, lending/borrowing, yield farming, collateralization and more. Stay tuned for more announcements and content on WBETH utility.

#### Do I need to claim staking rewards if I'm using WBETH?

No. Staking rewards accrue in the WBETH token. This means that the WBETH token will increase in value over ETH. You will be able to claim rewards once you convert WBETH back to ETH or swap to other tokens.

#### How do I convert WBETH back to ETH?

You can convert WBETH to ETH through our swap page. PancakeSwap is also working to support a conversion contract on our liquid staking page to convert WBETH back to ETH seamlessly.

StableSwap on PancakeSwap is a feature to trade stable pairs with a lower slippage based on an invariant curve slippage function. It is designed to swap specific assets that are priced closely â€“ such as USD stablecoins (e.g. HAY, BUSD and USDT) or liquid staking tokens (e.g. stkBNB and aBNBc).

The StableSwap is an implementation of Curve Financeâ€™s AMM on PancakeSwap. It adds linear invariant constant sum curve (x+y=k) on top of the constant product formula (x\*y=k) to keep prices more equal as long as the liquidity pool is not extremely unbalanced. As a result, since StableSwaps are restricted to similarly priced assets, impermanent loss is not as much of a concern (except in extreme depeg cases) and the slippage is lower than normal AMM which just uses the constant product formula.

When you conduct a Swap (trade) on the StableSwap you will pay lower trading fees, than the usual 0.25% on normal PancakeSwap AMM. The fee attribution is broken down as follows:

* 50% to the LP as rewards&#x20;
* 40% to CAKE buyback and burn&#x20;
* 10% to the PancakeSwap Treasury

## Stableswap Fees

Fees for pairs are broken down in the table below:

| Stablepair | Trading Fees | LP Rewards | CAKE Buyback | PancakeSwap Treasury |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| USDT-BUSD  | 0.15%        | 0.075%     | 0.06%        | 0.015%               |
| USDC-BUSD  | 0.15%        | 0.075%     | 0.06%        | 0.015%               |
| USDC-USDT  | 0.15%        | 0.075%     | 0.06%        | 0.015%               |
| HAY-BUSD   | 0.04%        | 0.02%      | 0.016%       | 0.004%               |

The Kitchen will gradually roll out StableSwap pairs and revise the fees to test and improve the product further.

## Why should I use the StableSwap instead of the normal AMM Swap?

* Swap your stablecoins or other pairs with similar asset prices more efficiently with the same trade steps&#x20;
* With the StableSwap function, the trading slippage is lower than normal AMM&#x20;
* The StableSwap trading fees are lower compared to the normal AMM

## Still Cooking&#x20;

* Better guides on UI regarding StableSwap and stable LPs&#x20;
* StableSwap information page&#x20;
* Adding more stable trading pairs and the migration process of existing LPs

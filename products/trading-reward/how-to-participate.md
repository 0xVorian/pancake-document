## Check if your address is eligible <a href="#ced8a6c5-803a-4a60-80d0-44e823571d84" id="ced8a6c5-803a-4a60-80d0-44e823571d84"></a>

To participate in a trading reward campaign. Your address must meet the following requirement:

* Must have an active Pancake Profile
* Must have an active fixed-term CAKE staking position
* The unlock time of the CAKE staking position must be no earlier than the threshold \
  (different in every campaign)

The easiest way to check if your address is eligible is to visit the [Trading Reward page](https://pancakeswap.finance/trading-reward) and connect your wallet. The page will guide you through the process to make your address eligible to earn CAKE from trades.

For example, you will be presented with the above screen if you do not have an active fixed-term CAKE staking position. Simply follow the guide to start locking CAKE.

You can lock ANY amount of CAKE. But please note that the amount of CAKE locked in the position will determine the maximum amount of rewards you can earn from the campaign.

While a campaign is active, you can start locking CAKE and join the campaign at any time. Trading rewards will be counted from the beginning of the campaign; how good is that?

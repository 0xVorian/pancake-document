Trading rewards is new series of campaigns designed to reward loyal PancakeSwap users and stakers. You can choose a campaign that suits you, start trading, become eligible, and claim up to a 10% trading fee rebate in CAKE from trading eligible PancakeSwap V3 pairs on BNB Chain and Ethereum mainnet.

Check out the following tutorial to learn how to participate in each of them:

**Note:** The two types of campaigns mentioned above are usually run in parallel. Although your trading volume/fee generated will be shared across both. When the campaigns end, you can only claim rewards from **ONE** of the campaigns. Once you've claimed from one campaign, you can NOT claim from the other one.

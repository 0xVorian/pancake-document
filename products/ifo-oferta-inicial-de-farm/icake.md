# iCAKE

iCAKE is similar to “IFO credits” from the previous IFO CAKE staking pool, which was retired during the MasterChef v2 migration. After this update, iCAKE will determine the maximum CAKE commit limit in the PancakeSwap IFO public sales. For example, if you have 200 iCAKE, you will be able to commit 200 CAKE in any upcoming IFO public sales.

If you are not sure about how the voting power is calculated, click on the ">" to bring up the detailed breakdown.

Please note that only CAKE held in the following places will contribute to the total number of voting power:

1.  2\.

    Flexible CAKE Staking (both in CAKE pool and side pool)
2.  3\.

    Fixed Term CAKE Staking (boosted by vCAKE!)
3.  4\.

    Other Syrup Pools (provided by other projects)

CAKE held in other places does not contribute to your voting power.

#### &#x20;<a href="#check-the-snapshot-block" id="check-the-snapshot-block"></a>

Voting power is calculated based on a snapshot taken on the snapshot block. Therefore, purchasing or depositing more CAKE after the proposal is posted is not going to increase the voting power for that particular proposal.

If you want to know the exact time of the snapshot block. Simple click on the block number and look for the timestamp on the BscScan page.

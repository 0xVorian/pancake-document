### Extra Note on Position

* Please note that the expiration timer doesn't start when you click on the 'OpenPosition' button; instead, the 60-second / selected duration countdown commences from the instant the transaction gets confirmed on the blockchain
* The price you see displayed serves only as a reference. The final entry price will be determined by the price point at the exact moment the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. This will be updated on the “position” tab

### Tips for Using Dumb Mode

* Understand the Risks: Be aware of the high risks involved, especially with the -100% ROI on losses.
* Manage Your Collateral: Only invest what you can afford to lose.
* Stay Informed: Keep up to date with market trends for the assets you're trading.

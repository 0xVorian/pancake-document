# Perpetual Trading FAQ

### What is the value contribution of this new feature to the cake holders?

We expect this new feature to bring in a lot of new users, traders and volume. We want to ensure the value goes back to our CAKE token on top of offering the trading fee discount. A portion of all opening and closing fees from users who sign up on PancakeSwap will be converted to CAKE and burnt.&#x20;

**And the rest of it?**

The rest are currently reserved for the treasury for ongoing expansion and development of this feature. As the feature matures, we expect to increase the burn portion gradually based on community feedback and governance. Moving forward, we'll look to reward CAKE holders with the increasing adoption of Perpetual Trading V2.

### How does ApolloX determine which user is from PancakeSwap and which user is from their own website?

This is based on the platform where users trade. If users open and close trades on [https://perp.pancakeswap.finance/](https://perp.pancakeswap.finance/), they will be considered PancakeSwap user.

[Pancake Protectors](https://protectors.pancakeswap.finance/) is an interactive, tower-defense inspired game which is a collaboration between PancakeSwap and Mobox, two established protocols on the BNB Chain.

Players can engage in both single-player and multiplayer elements. Hope you have fun!

### How to play the game?

At the beginning of the game, there is a simple tutorial which explains the general gameplay and how to use the starting level characters.

The tutorial does not cover advanced gameplay mechanics, as this is for players to research and find the best ways to play. We recommend you go to our community channels in PancakeSwap’s Telegram and Discord channels to see what other players are discussing.

### What are the tokenomics?

Pancake Protectors is not a play-to-earn style of game where actions are automatically rewarded with BEP-20 tokens. Instead, users can spend CAKE in-game for various features (e.g. recruiting CAKE Heroes), and all spent CAKE are distributed in the following manner:

| Category                                   | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Returned to users through seasonal rewards | 70%        |
| CAKE burn                                  | 12.5%      |
| Mobox                                      | 5%         |
| Future developments                        | 12.5%      |

### What are the main things to explore in the game?

Suggestions here will not cover all things that can be done in the game, but here are the aspects that we suggest you explore:

* Seasonal competitions and prizes

There are many multiplayer aspects to the game; we encourage users to actively participate and enjoy the multiplayer aspects so that they can get the best experience.

# FAQ

### What happens if I do not withdraw after lock period ends?

Once the lock period ends, users will be able to withdraw their staking rewards and principle amount. If a user does not withdraw, the funds will still receive flexible daily rewards, which have a lower payout than locked staking rewards.&#x20;

### What are the fees for early withdrawal?

Should you choose to withdraw your funds early, schedules and penalties are as follows:

| Withdrawl Fees/Pool   | 30 Day        | 60 Day        | 90 Day        |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| No Withdrawal         | First 10 Days | First 20 Days | First 30 Days |
| 15% of deposit amount | 11-20 Days    | 21-40 Days    | 31-60 Days    |
| 2% of deposit amount  | 21-30 Days    | 41-60 Days    | 61-90 Days    |
| No Fee                | 30 Day Unlock | 60 Day Unlock | 90 Day Unlock |

For more clarity on how the days are counted, refer to the following example of a 30D pool starting Oct 1 at 11:00hrs:

From Oct 1 11:00hrs to Oct 11 11:59hrs -> No Withdrawal

From  Oct 11 12:00hrs to Oct 21 12:00hrs  -> 15% Fee

From  Oct 21 12:00hrs to Oct 31 11:59hrs  -> 2% Fee

After Oct 31 12:00hrs -> No Fee
